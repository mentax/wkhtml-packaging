# Binary releases of the final wkhtmltopdf release 0.12.6.1

The wkhtmltopdf project was archived at version 0.12.6.1, but I still use it
in my projects. This repo provides binary releases (both complete deb files
and just the wkhtmlpdf binary) for current (amd64) versions of debian and ubuntu.

- Debian 12: bookworm
- Debian 11: bullseye
- Ubuntu 24.04: noble
- Ubuntu 22.04: jammy
